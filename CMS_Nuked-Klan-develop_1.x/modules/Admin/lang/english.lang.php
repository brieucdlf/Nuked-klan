define("_LICENCES","Licence GNU/GPL");
define("_LICENCETXT","1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as 
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately 
publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any 
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License 
along with the Program.<br />
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at 
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus 
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications 
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of 
these conditions:<br />
<br />
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating that you 
changed the files and the date of any change.<br />
<br />
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in 
part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed 
as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.<br />
<br />
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you 
must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most 
ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate 
copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that 
you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these 
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License. (Exception: 
if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print such an 
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print an 
announcement.)<br />
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably 
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and 
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate 
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a 
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of 
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, 
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your 
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the 
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the 
Program.<br />
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the 
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or 
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this 
License.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under Section 
2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above 
provided that you also do one of the following:<br />
<br />
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, 
which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium 
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br />
<br />
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give 
any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically performing 
source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding 
source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br />
<br />
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to distribute 
corresponding source code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial 
distribution and only if you received the program in object code or executable 
form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making 
modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the 
source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface 
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation 
of the executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed 
need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or 
binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the 
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself 
accompanies the executable.<br />
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy 
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code 
from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third 
parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<br />
<br />
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as 
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, 
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate 
your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so 
long as such parties remain in full compliance.<br />
<br />
<br />
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. 
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program 
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not 
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any 
work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do 
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the 
Program or works based on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program), 
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to 
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. 
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the 
rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third 
parties to this License.<br />
<br />
<br />
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement 
or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed 
on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the 
conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your 
obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a 
consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. For example, if a patent 
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those 
who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you 
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from 
distribution of the Program.<br />
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any 
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and the 
section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or 
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this 
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software 
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices. Many 
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software 
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to 
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that 
choice.<br />
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a 
consequence of the rest of this License.<br />
<br />
<br />
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain 
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright 
holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit 
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that 
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such 
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this 
License.<br />
<br />
<br />
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the 
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in 
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems 
or concerns.<br />
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies 
a version number of this License which applies to it and any later version, 
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version 
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the 
Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any 
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.<br />
<br />
<br />
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs 
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for 
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, 
write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of 
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of 
software generally.<br />
NO WARRANTY<br />
<br />
<br />
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE 
PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED 
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM AS 
IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE 
PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF 
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br />
<br />
<br />
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL 
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE 
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, 
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY 
TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING 
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF 
THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER 
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br />
